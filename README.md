# football-leauge-mangement-system

 This is a Java program which simulates the manipulation of a football championship.
I have implemeneted a class PremierLeagueManager which extends interface LeagueManager. The
PremierLeagueManager class maintains a number of football clubs which play in the premier
league.
When the main method is run, You can choose from the following options:

 1) to create a new football club and add it to the league
 2) to delete a team from the league
 3) to display the team stats
 4) to display the table
 5) to add a played match
 
 when a team is added,You can add a played match between two teams you have created. You also can then use the other options to know about the team stats and their positions on the table.
